## What is Rigid?

Rigid is the missing layer between AI-generated code and production-ready software. AI agents can generate entire applications—they scaffold features, write tests, and deploy infrastructure. But what they produce is a rough draft, not a finished product.

The gap between "generated" and "shippable" is where human judgment lives. Rigid fills that gap with tools built for a new kind of developer: **the sculptor, not the scribe.**

## Features

### Explore
Map what the agents built. Navigate every surface, trace every decision, and maintain a living exploration log of your inherited codebase.

</p>

### Document
Capture findings as you learn. Annotate screenshots, record video evidence, and create a traceable narrative from chaos to clarity.

### Deliver
Ship with confidence. Validate edge cases, verify intent, and close the loop on what matters before your users feel the gaps.
